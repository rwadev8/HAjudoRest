# HAjudoRest

Example of rest sensors for HomeAssistant to get local Judo iSoft Safe+ data via the Connectivity module (https://judo.eu/en/products/connectivity-modul-wlan/)

## Background

This provides a basic example how to aquire data from a Judo iSoft Safe+ water softening system via the Judo Rest interface into HomeAssistant.
The communication is local via the connectivity module, it does not require any cloud/web service. I use the LAN connection of the module.
